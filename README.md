## What this Is

This is the source code for [more-features-for-notion](https://github.com/kulesko/more-features-for-notion), a browser extension for Chrome that adds so far absent features to [notion](https://www.notion.so/) inspired by other popular applications like [Trello](https://trello.com/). It is 100% free and open-source.

If you are only interested in running the latest version, you don't need this repo. You can get the latest version through the Chrome Extensions Marketplace, **as soon as available**.

## Features
<details>
  <summary>Flexible Dividers in a Board</summary>
  <p>
  Prepend "==" to the name of a card in a board column and it will be rendered as a divider. Use this for instance to give more structure to your Kanban boards. Inspired by Trello.
  </p>
</details>

## Getting Started

Configuration is handled from within Notion itself, so you can start right off. For a consistent experience every member of your team needs to install the same version of the extention.
